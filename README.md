Utopia Messaging library is simple and lite library for sending messages using multiple messaging adapters. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the [Utopia Framework](https://github.com/utopia-php/framework) project it is dependency free, and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.
